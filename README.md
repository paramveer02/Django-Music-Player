# Django-Music-Player
Music Player Website built on Django - Python
Project: Music Player
app: App
In this Django based Website, i have made an Audio Player, that resembles Spotify
I have connected the database with the logic that allows admin access to add remove songs
Allowance to add the following for the song:
  1. Title for the song
  2. Image for the song
  3. Duration
  4. Name of the Artist
Also, Pagination was an interesting concept to implement on this website, that allowed me to implement 1 song per page
For styling the Front end of the website, Javascript, Css and Bootstrap 4 code i have implemented
Enjoy!
